The project addresses an unidentified problem in our educational system.

Students have multiple subjects,taught by different teachers.
Each teacher considers not what the other teachers gave to the student as home-work or a preparation task for the next day.
A student can therefore on any given day, recieve an overload of homework, exapml,15 mathematics exercises,200 word english essay,and an informal test for physical sciences for the next day.
This creates pressure for the student and may cause an argument amoung the students and each teacher,since the teachers dont really know what the other teachers demanded from the students.

This project solves this by allowing each teacher of each subject to post what they gave the student as home-work or preparation task.
The program will then send and api request to chatgpt to estimate how long it'll take the average learner to complete that particular task.It will then send a response of the number of minutes it takes an average 
learner to complete that task.

The program will do that for each subject and display if the workload has exceeded the maximum amount of time to complete a task at home.
It'll then ask the teachers to adjust the tasks they've given to the students.
Every student who uses the program will be able to see what was adjusted byu each teacher for their home-work.
